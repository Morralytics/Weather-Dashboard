# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is designed to create a working web page that offers a place to search a city and retrieve a 5 day weather forecast based on your search. It will show you a variety of information that is able to be stored in local storage and access easily upon return. I unfortunately was unable to finish the project in full on time this week due to not fully understanding API's and need to spend more time with the tutors this coming week. Questions on how to do certain things like grouping the API dt information into a single day throughout the 3 hour intervals was confusing and research was not able to aid me.
